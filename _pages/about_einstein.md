Welcome! Our research focuses on the exploration of `Information Spreading Dynamics in Complex Systems`, such as social networks and communication systems, by employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates statistical physics, information theory, and network science. We seek to `Unveil`, `Understand`, and `Model` the collective dynamical behaviors triggered by individual interactions within these systems. Our research has been published in leading journals such as `Nature Human Behaviour` and `PNAS`, among others.
